# VOiC
A project by Austin Kugler and Hayden Carroll for CS-360.

# Description
While almost all of the documents we write, read, share, act on, process or archive are digital, their management remains archaic. In VOiC, we make provisions to support decision workflows, virtual office and provenance and privacy based on role-based authorization. The system is based upon a recently proposed model for document management in virtual offices.

# Setup
```
git clone https://github.com/austinpkugler/voic.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
export FLASK_APP=routes.py
export FLASK_DEBUG=1
python run.py
```
